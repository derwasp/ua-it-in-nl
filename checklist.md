# Checklist

This checklist contains points you have to do before you request a CV review from the group. Unless you have done this, we won't be able to help. Since most of the work has to come from you, and we are here to guide and help.  
Though we want to help, and we will help you with phrasing and all that, we want you to understand the end goal as much as possible.
